        <p class="hero-lead">
          A credit card is not a full financial plan – it is one tool in a bigger picture that includes income,
          savings, emergency buffers and long-term goals. This page explains how to think about credit cards as part
          of your finances, not the centre of them.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Credit Cards as a Financial Tool</h2>
      <p>
        Used carefully, credit cards can help you smooth cash flow, add protections to purchases and earn modest rewards.
        Used without a plan, they can turn everyday spending into expensive debt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking about cards in a financial context means asking questions like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How does this card interact with my monthly budget?</li>
        <li>What happens if I cannot pay the full balance one month?</li>
        <li>Do the benefits justify the fees and potential risks?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal is not to avoid cards completely, but to understand their role and limits.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Cash flow & budgeting -->
    <section id="cashflow" class="section">
      <h2>Cash Flow, Budgeting & Short-Term Timing</h2>
      <p>
        One of the main reasons people use credit cards is timing: you buy now and pay later. That can be helpful if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You know when income is coming in, and you plan to pay in full.</li>
        <li>You use the statement cycle to group and review spending.</li>
        <li>You track subscriptions and recurring charges in one place.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But if balances roll from month to month, interest can quickly outweigh any rewards. In a financial plan,
        the healthiest pattern is usually:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear monthly budget with a cap on card spending.</li>
        <li>Automatic full-balance payment where possible.</li>
        <li>Emergency fund outside your card limit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your card is then a payment channel, not your backup emergency fund.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risk & boundaries -->
    <section id="risk" class="section">
      <h2>Risk, Debt & Healthy Boundaries</h2>
      <p>
        From a finance perspective, the main risk with credit cards is <strong>persistent high-interest debt</strong>.
        Carrying a balance every month reduces your future options: less room for saving, investing and handling shocks.
      </p>
      <p>Healthy boundaries many people use include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only using credit cards for planned expenses in the budget.</li>
        <li>Keeping total utilisation (used limit / total limit) moderate.</li>
        <li>Having a clear plan to pay down any carried balance.</li>
        <li>Not relying on credit limits as “spare cash”.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If debt is already a problem, debt-management resources and independent advice are often more important
        than choosing a new card.
